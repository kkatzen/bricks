Files:
enviornment.html: This is what you open to see the tests that pass and fail in your browser.
qunit-1.17.1.css: Used by environment.html for display
qunit-1.17.1.js:  Used to run Qunit tests.
tests.js:         Contains tests for the new pnut.js functions.

Setup: environment, and the qunit files come from: https://qunitjs.com.  
I specified the qunit-1.17.1.js, qunit-1.17.1.css, acorn and pnut as src in environment.html, 
if you want to change the directory structure, you will need to update the relative paths to 
these files to ensure the tests continue to work.


tests.js: This is where you’ll add more test cases.
    Organization:
	Each function is in its own QUnit.test function.
	Each group of tests is specified by QUnit.module( "group number” );  (This is less import-
	ant for making new tests).

    This is the format of the tests placed inside QUnit.test statement: 
  		code  = “code to be tested”
		AST  = acorn.parse(code);
  		assert.deepEqual( pnut.testFunction(AST), expectedVal,  “Function number case test number”);
  	Or if you want something truthy:
  		assert.ok( pnut.testFunction(AST),    “Function number case test number”);

Running the tests: To run the unit tests, simply open environment.html in your browser.  I recommend using chrome,
as that was what I used, and I know Safari does not work on a couple of the cases.
The tests should execute, and feedback should be provided on tests that passed and failed.

If you’re getting started with qunit, this is a fantastic page to get you up to speed, and
